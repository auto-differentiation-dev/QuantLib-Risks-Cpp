As a demonstrator of integration of the [XAD automatic differentation tool](https://auto-differentiation.github.io) with real-world code, 
the latest release of QuantLib is AAD-enabled with XAD. 
The performance achieved on sample applications is many-fold superior to what has been reported previously with other tools. 
This demonstrates production quality use of the XAD library in a code-base of several hundred thousand lines.

This repository contains integration headers, examples, and tests required
for this integration.
It is not usable stand-alone.

## Getting Started

## License

Due to the nature of this repository, two different licenses have to be used for 
different part of the code-base.
The [tests](test-suite/) and [examples](Examples/) folders are containing code taken
and modified from QuantLib where the [QuantLib license](test-suite/LICENSE.TXT) applies.
The [ql](ql/) folder contains adaptor modules for XAD,
where the [GNU AGPL](ql/LICENSE.md) applies.
This is clearly indicated by having separate license files in each folder.
